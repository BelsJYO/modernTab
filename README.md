3. Refresh any open new tab pages to see changes

### Adding New Search Engines
Edit the `SEARCH_ENGINES` object in `js/newtab.js`:

```javascript
const SEARCH_ENGINES = {
    // ... existing engines
    newsearch: {
        name: 'New Search Engine',
        url: 'https://example.com/search?q=%s'
    }
};
```

Then add the option to the select element in `newtab.html`.
